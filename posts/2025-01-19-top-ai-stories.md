## Universities Worldwide Implement New AI Regulations
Leading institutions, spearheaded by Fudan University in Shanghai, are establishing comprehensive guidelines for AI usage in academic settings. These regulations aim to balance the integration of AI tools in education while maintaining academic integrity and ensuring ethical use of AI technologies.

## The Evolution of Small Language Models (SLMs)
As highlighted in MIT Technology Review's latest analysis, small language models are emerging as a major trend in 2025. These more efficient, specialized AI models are gaining traction for their reduced computational requirements and focused capabilities, potentially revolutionizing how AI is deployed in specific industry applications.

## ELIZA Chatbot Revival Project
In an interesting blend of AI history and modern technology, the pioneering ELIZA chatbot from the 1960s has been successfully revived after its original code was previously thought to be lost. This restoration provides valuable insights into the evolution of conversational AI and demonstrates how far the technology has progressed in the past decades.
